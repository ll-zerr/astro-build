    <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

    {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}
    {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}
    {goal === 5 ? <p>My goal is to finish in 5 days.</p> : <p>My goal is not 3 days.    </p>}

    <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. I was introduced to Astro via the organization I volunteer with and wanted to investigate further to enhance my understanding of the use of StarLight and Astro for documentation!</p>

    <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>

    <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
        <li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
        {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
            <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
        }
    </ul>
    <p>My skills are:</p>
    <ul>
        {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>
