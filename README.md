# Cozy Country Community Blog

This project initiated from the desire to learn how to use Astro and Starlight for technical documentation. It began as a base project created from the [Astro tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/).

## 🚀 How to Start Your Own Astro Project
### Astro Starter Kit: Minimal Template

```sh
yarn create astro@latest -- --template minimal
```

### Project Structure Insights

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where Astro likes to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `yarn dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `yarn build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `yarn preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `yarn astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `yarn astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
